# Graph-Traversal-Puzzle
Apply Graph traversal to solve a problem (Portfolio Project Problem)

## Run Program
- In the driver code, change Source and Destination variables to desire coordinates
- Run using command "python3 puzzle.py"

## Problem Description
You are given a 2-D puzzle of size MxN, that has N rows and M column (N>=3 ; M >= 3; M 
and N can be different). Each cell in the puzzle is either empty or has a barrier. An empty cell 
is marked by ‘-’ (hyphen) and the one with a barrier is marked by ‘#’. You are given two 
coordinates from the puzzle (a,b) and (x,y). You are currently located at (a,b) and want to 
reach (x,y). You can move only in the following directions.
- L: move to left cell from the current cell
- R: move to right cell from the current cell
- U: move to upper cell from the current cell
- D: move to the lower cell from the current cell

You can move to only an empty cell and cannot move to a cell with a barrier in it. Your goal 
is to find the minimum number of cells that you have to cover to reach the destination cell 
(do not count the starting cell and the destination cell). The coordinates (1,1) represent the 
first cell; (1,2) represents the second cell in the first row. If there is not possible path from 
source to destination return None.
Sample Input Puzzle Board: [[-,-,-,-,-],[-,-,#,-,-],[-,-,-,-,-],[#,-,#,#,-],[-#,-,-,-]]


### Example 1: (a,b) : (1,3) ; (x,y): (3,3)
- Output: 3
- On possible direction to travel: LDDR
- (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)

### Example 2: (a,b): (1,1) ; (x,y): (5,5)
- Output: 7
- One possible direction to travel: DDRRRRDD
- (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2)-> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5)

### Example 3: (a,b): (1,1); (x,y) : (5,1)
- Output: None

## Solution
- For this problem I’m going to use a breadth first approach to find the solution. Starting from the given Source
variable, it will go up,down, left, and right and record the results will be saved in a
dictionary only if it doesn’t have a barrier ‘#’. We will use heaps in order to
accomplish this. When we reach our desired Destination coordinates, we will
return the total steps/cells it took to reach the goal. If we reach the end of the
board (the end edges) then there is no solution and None is returned.

- Time complexity: Used Breadth First approach so O(V+E)
